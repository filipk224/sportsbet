# sports_betting
 
A personal project, going through constant refinement

Using my mentality on sports, I have hand picked qualifying attributes I don't wish to disclose. You are free to look through the code

Upcoming work:
 - Tweak errors on alternate slips
 - Inclusion of new teams respective to leagues
 - Addition of leagues as they begin

Long term ideas:
 - Self judging acceptable parameters
 - Calculate previous season statistic's into beggining season's
 - Tkinter window for neat output
 - E-mail at sufficient frequency

Notes:
 - Requires Scrapy
 - Betting site is Australian based
