# sports_betting
 
A personal project, going through constant refinement as we go

Using my mentality on sports, I have hand picked qualifying attributes I don't wish to disclose. You are free to look through the code

Upcoming work:
 - Tweak errors for alternate slips as they arrive
 - Inclusion of teams to respective leagues appearing for their first time since involved
 - Addition of leagues as they begin

Long term ideas:
 - Self judging acceptable parameters

Notes:
 - Requires Scrapy
 - Betting site is Australian based
